1.	 Which class would you use to store your birthday in years, months, days, seconds, and nanoseconds?
		I would use the LocalDateTime class because it tracks date and time.

		You would find it using the previous method from the TemporalAdjusters class.
		
		
3.	 What is the difference between a ZoneId and a ZoneOffset?
		ZoneID uses ZoneRules to figure out the offest from the Greenwich time and ZoneOffset only uses the absolute offset to  figure out the
		offset from the Greenwich time. 
		
		
4.	 How would you convert an Instant to a ZonedDateTime? How would you convert a ZonedDateTime to an Instant?
		To convert an Instant to a ZonedDateTime you would need a ZoneID and use the ZonedDateTime.ofInstance method.
		To convert a ZonedDateTime to and Instance you implement the ChronoZonedDateTime interface and use the toInstant method.
